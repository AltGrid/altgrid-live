                         ALTGRID SYSTEM 1.0 — TERMINAL NODE
================================================================================

Welcome, Operator.

This shell is now active. You are operating in a full-text station.
No GUI is present. None is expected.

This node is part of the AltGrid network — a resilient, offline, 
text-based relay for field communication, packet routing, and 
sneakernet exchange.

  PRIMARY COMMANDS:
    aghelp         - view operator command index (start here)
    pulse          - send test signal to network
    reset-station  - restart this node’s comm layer
    hello          - confirm terminal is live

  NETWORK LINK:
    Not connected by default. Link via:
      • USB LoRa device (/dev/ttyUSB0)
      • Serial bridge or file relay
      • .stamp exchange via sneakernet

  OPERATING NOTES:
    • All messages are text. All logs are real.
    • Check your routes. Verify your time.
    • Trust nothing until you read it twice.

You are the protocol now. Proceed accordingly.
